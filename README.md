# chinoot

A Flutter project for showcasing recipes in detail. This application leverages RapidAPI for accessing various recipe-related APIs, providing a rich and dynamic user experience.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application focused on displaying recipes with detailed information. It uses Provider for state management and follows Clean Code architecture principles for a well-structured and maintainable codebase.


To fetch data from the API, you need to configure your `api_client.dart` file with the API key provided by RapidAPI. Define the API key as a `String` named `apiKey` in this file to authenticate and retrieve data.

### What is RapidAPI?

[RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/) is a platform that connects developers with thousands of APIs from various providers. It offers a unified interface for discovering, testing, and managing APIs. RapidAPI simplifies the process of integrating third-party APIs into your application, providing a central place for API management and monitoring.
